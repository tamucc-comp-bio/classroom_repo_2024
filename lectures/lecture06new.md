<p>

- [ ] Step 0. Open Terminal

  > Search for the terminal app and open it.  For Windows, make sure you are using Ubuntu.

  > You should have already prepared your computer during Lecture 0.  If you did not then:  

  > * Complete the tasks listed in the [How to Set Up Your Computer for Computational Biology](https://github.com/tamucc-comp-bio/how_to/blob/main/howto_setup_computer.md), up to, but not including R and RStudio.
  >    * If you are having difficulty installing ubuntu, use Launch if your account is activated.

- [ ] Step 1. Update Your apps

  > It's always a good idea to keep your apps in your terminal up to date. 
  
  > For Ubuntu (Linux), enter the following commands to load the newest versions of your apps

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade
  ```

  > For Mac (Homebrew), enter the following commands to load the newest versions of your apps

  ```bash
  brew update
  brew upgrade
  ```

- [ ] Step 2. Confirm you have cloned the CSB (Computing Skills For Biologists) Repo into your home dir

    > In your terminal, enter the following commands:

    ```bash
    # make sure you're in your home dir
    cd ~
    
    # list the directories and files in the CSB dir to confirm it's in your home dir
    ls CSB
    ```

    > You should see the following output because we cloned the CSB Repo to your home dir in [Lecture 0](https://github.com/tamucc-comp-bio/classroom_repo_2024/blob/master/lectures/lecture00.md).  

    ```bash
    LICENSE  README.md  data_wrangling  git  good_code  latex  python  r  regex  scientific  sql  unix
    ```

    > If you see the output above, you're done! Goto the next section.

- [ ] Step 3. If you didn't have the CSB Repo, clone it now

  > If you **do not** see the output above, then clone the CSB repo by entering the following commands:

    ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB.git
    ``` 

  > You should see the following output:

    ```bash
    Cloning into 'CSB'...

## I. Review Material Covered for Homework

<details><summary>R Scripts</summary>
<p>


Scripts are text files that contain the commands you give to R and have many advantages in biological research.  Your text editor (Notepad ++ or BBedit) is used to write scripts and has many functions built in to aid in code writing.  R Studio is a special development environment for writing, testing, and running R scripts that we will cover shortly, but not yet.

* Recycling

  * similar analyses can be adapted quickly

* Automation

  * if you make a mistake, it’s easy to fix and redo analysis

* Documentation

  * analyses are precisely recorded for evaluation 

* Share

  * submit with your manuscript, review for errors

<details><summary>Writing Good Code</summary>
<p>


#### Use descriptive names with [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) or words_separated_by_underscores

* Files 	– `model_fitting.R`   

* Variables 	– `body_mass`

* Functions 	– `calculate_cv`

#### Be consistent in use of spaces

```R
# poor formatting
X<-5*7

# good formatting
X <- 5*7
X <- 5 * 7
M <- matrix(25, 5, 5)
Z <- mean(m, na.rm == TRUE)
```

#### Use indenting to organize hierarchical code

```R
if (b == 5) {
	do(something)
} else {
	do(something_else)
}
```

#### Document your code so that it is easy to understand what you are trying to accomplish

* After a shebang!, the first line(s) of your R script should describe what the R script does and how to use it

* Provide descriptions of what your blocks of code do in the line(s) preceding the block of code

* Use tabs to align comments

#### Use empty lines to break up sections of code

#### Load libraries and set hard-coded variables at the beginning in one location, rather than scattering them throughout the script

<details><summary>R `for` and `while` Loops</summary>
<p>

Allows you to perform repetitive tasks in a few lines of code. A `for` loop has a predetermined number of cycles where as a `while` loop will cycle continuously until a condition is met.  Be careful with `while` loops because they could run infinitely if the condition is never met.

Anatomy of the `for` loop

```R
# pseudo code, do not type in
for(i in list_or_vector){
	Do something with i
}
```

Anatomy of  the `while` loop

```R
# pseudo code, do not type in
while(condition is TRUE){
	Execute commands
	Update condition
}
```

Exit a loop using `break`

```R
if(i >7){break}
```

Try out the code below that demonstrates how `for` and `while` loops work differently by performing the same task.

```R
rm(list=ls())
myvec <- 1:10     #make vector from 1 to 10
for(i in myvec){  #for each value in myvec
  a <- i^2        #square it
  print(a)        #and print the square
}                 #goto next value in myvec

i <- 1            #set i = 1
while(i <= 10){   #while i <= 10 
  a <- i^2        #square i
  print(a)        #print the square
  i <- i + 1      #increase i by 1
}                 #goto while line

```

<details><summary>R `if`-`then` Logic Statements</summary>
<p>

Run code conditionally, only if something is true or false.

Anatomy of the if statement

```R
# this is pseudocode, do not type in
if(a condition is TRUE){    
	execute these commands
} 
```

```R
# this is pseudocode, do not type in
if(a condition is TRUE){    
	execute these commands
} else {
	execute these other commands
}
```

For multiple conditions, replace 

```R
# this is pseudocode, do not type in
if(a condition is TRUE){    
	execute these commands
} else if(2nd condition is TRUE){
	execute these other commands
}
else {
	execute these other commands
}
```

Try out this code to see how `if`-`then` statements work

```R
#if statements
rm(list=ls())
x <- seq(1,50,3)
y <- sample(x, size=1, replace = TRUE) #randomly sample 1 value from vector x

if(y%%2 == 0){
  print(paste(y, "is even"))
} else {
  print(paste(y, "is odd"))
}

# copy this code and paste it into R terminal a few times.  What is happening?
y <- sample(x, size=1, replace = TRUE) #randomly sample 1 value from vector x
if(y%%2 == 0){
  print(paste(y, "is even"))
} else if(y%%2 != 0) {
  print(paste(y, "is odd"))
}
```

## II. New Material: R Studio


<details><summary>R Studio</summary>
<p>

#### [R Studio](https://rstudio.com/) is a [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) Integrated Development Environment ([IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RStudio)) for `R` 

`R Studio` was completely free, but it has become a "dot com" when it was acquired by Microsoft (I think).  It is still free for academic use.  If/When they charge for it, academics will stop using it.  It is still open source and could be forked.  Fun fact, `R` was made to be an opensource version of of [`S`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_%28programming_language%29), just like `linux` is an opensource version of `unix`.  

Connections: the Chief Engineer of R Studio is [Hadley Wickham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_Wickham), who coined and codified "tidy data". He will come up again when we get into "the tidyverse", which essentially replaces almost all basic R functionality with a different philosophy. I think of it as essentially R 2.0. Realize, however, you do NOT need R Studio to use the "tidyverse".

<details><summary>Installing `R Studio`</summary>
<p>

_If you already did this when following the instructions to prep your computer at the top of this doc, then you do not have to do this again._

If you have a Mac and you already installed `R` for use in your terminal, you do not need to reinstall it.

If you have a windows computer, you will need to separately install `R` in the windows environment even if you already installed it in Ubuntu.

<details><summary>`R Studio` Layout</summary>
<p>

R Studio is organized, by default, into 4 panels:

* A text editor (upper left)

  * this is where you view and edit your scripts

* The `console`/`terminal` (lower left)

  * this gives you access to the R or bash command line, just as we have been using in our terminal windows
  
    * the `console` is the `R` command line

    *  the `terminal` is a rudimentary `bash` command line

* The `global environment` (upper right)

  * here you can view your data containers (i.e. variables) and their attributes

* The `plots`/`help` windows (lower right)

  * here you can view plots or search for help

Note that there can be several tabs in the panels, allowing you to toggle between different screens of information.

<details><summary>Acclimating to the `R Studio` IDE</summary>
<p>

Follow the instructions in the following image to see the difference between the `text editor` panel and the `console` pane.

![](Week06_files/rstudio_acclimation.png)

Text Editor (upper left)

* Place to craft your code

  * To identify code to run, either highlight with mouse or place cursor anywhere on that line
  
  * To run code on line, use the following keystrokes: `Ctrl` + `Enter`
  
  * To run code on all lines: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `S`
  
  * try it

Console (lower left)

* Native `R` interface

  * Without R Studio, this is how you would interface with R

  * this work exactly like R did when run in your terminals

  * the difference between the `console` and the `terminal` is 

    * the `console` is the `R` command line

    *  the `terminal` is a rudimentary `bash` command line (try using `ls` in the `terminal` tab in the lower left panel)


Type in the following code in your text editor to save values into variables `x` and `y`, then run it.  _Note that your line numbers in the text editor will not be exactly the same as in the image._

![](Week06_files/rstudio_acclimation2.png)

Global Environment (upper right)

* Note that when you ran your code, not only did it show up in the `console` (make sure you select the `console` tab, but the values for `x` and `y` showed up in the `global environment`

  * this is where you can see all variables that have been defined
  
  * you can also see information about the variables that is equivalent to the `str(variable)` command
  
    * for example, now you can see that `x` is a "value", and not a "vector", "matrix", "array", "list", or "data frame"

## III. New Material: More R, but now in R Studio

From here forward, I request that you please work in R Studio, unless otherwise specified, to reduce minor issues that might crop up between platforms. However, it is important to realize that everything we are learning will also work in the R terminal from the linux/unix command line and with minor exceptions, _almost_ nothing we cover will be only usable in R Studio.

You should type commands into the R Studio `text editor` (upper left panel) and then execute them from there using your mouse or arrow keys and `ctrl` + `enter`.  You can save your work as you would in other GUI apps.


<details><summary>Required Housekeeping for Windows Only, Clone CSB Dir Into Your Windows Home Dir</summary>
<p>

_If you already did this when following the instructions to prep your computer at the top of this doc, then you do not have to do this again._

For now, we should all be in the `sandbox` for the `r` chapter in `CSB`. 

Just to make things a little more tricky, if you have windows, it is not easy to access the `CSB` repo that you cloned to your home directory in Ubuntu from RStudio. So, we have to clone the repo again, but this time to the `Downloads` dir inside your windows home dir.

Open your ubuntu terminal and navigate to your windows `Downloads` directory, then clone the CSB repo to there.

```bash
# make sure you are in ubuntu
cd /mnt/c/Users/YourWinUserName/Downloads
git clone git@github.com:tamucc-comp-bio-2022/CSB.git
```

You can now close the ubuntu terminal. (single tear)

<details><summary>RStudio Working Directories</summary>
<p>

*Never has specifying the present working directory been more critical than in R Studio.*  This is one of the achilles heels of R Studio, and the linux terminal is actually more convenient and intuitive. 

*_You will need to be vigilent in setting your present working directory each time you open `R Studio` and every time you switch between scripts that are found in different directories._* 

When you open R Studio, you will generally be in your home directory for the operating system you are running R Studio in.  It cannot hurt to check:

```R
# view the present working dir
getwd()
```

If you are not in your home directory, you can easily navigate there:

```R
# set the present working dir to home
setwd(~)

# view the present working dir
getwd()
```

Now let us move to the `sandbox` for the `r` chapter in `CSB`

```R
# Make sure your CSB repo has been cloned by viewing the dirs 
list.dirs(recursive=FALSE)

# change working directory to CSB/r/sandbox
setwd("~/CSB/r/sandbox")

# view the present working dir
getwd()
```

---

</p>
</details>


<details><summary>RStudio Working Directories - Pro Solution</summary>
<p>

There is a "magic" line of code that will solve all of your working directory issues in R.

You must have the `rstudioapi` package installed 

```r
install.packages("rstudioapi")
```

And your script in the code editor panel of RStudio must be saved on your computer, or else you will get an error because the document does not exist in the directory structure.  Use the GUI to save a blank script to `CSB/r/sandbox/lecture_06.R`

```r
# check your working dir by running this in the 'console' (lower left panel)
getwd()
```

Then, copy the magic line of code below into your script and run it.

```r
# this line of code is the first line in every R script I make.
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))

# Now witness the magic by typing this into the "console" (lower left panel)
getwd()

# You're welcome, and remember this moment when you're evaluating the course ;-)
```

There is one caveat.  This line will break your code if it is not run in RStudio.  Consequently, you should comment it out when not using RStudio.  If you want to be super slick, you could put it inside of a logic statement that determines whether the code is being run in R Studio.  When you're running a script from command line, it sets the working dir to the dir the script is in, so this line or `setwd()` should not be needed.

---

</p>
</details>


<details><summary>R Functions</summary>
<p>

Thus far we have used several built-in functions of R

`seq`, `for`, `if`, `while`, `print`, `sample`, `dim`, `head`, `tail`, `getwd`, `setwd`, …

It is also possible to define your own functions

```R
# this is pseudo code, do not type in
MyFunction <- function (optional arguments){
	Execute commands
	return(data)   # optional
}
```

* You specify the name of the function by replaceing `MyFunction` with a name of your choosing

* Replace `optional arguments` with a comma delimited list of variables (you choose the their names) that will store values you specify when running the function.  

  * this is how you pass data into the function
  
  * variables defined outside of the function are not available inside of the function unless they are passed in as arguments
  
* A function is usually meant to return information, the `stdout`, that is available outside of the function

  * you can specify the `stdout` with the `return` command 
  
* When you make a function, try to make it follow the [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)

Remember, functions must be read into the environment before you can use them.  Like Las Vegas, what happens in a function, stays in a function... except for the data it `return`s

Let us make our first R function:

```R
# enter the following line of code and function into your text editor (upper left panel), which should be empty
rm(list=ls())

# function to check whether number is triangular
isTriangular <-
  function(y){
    #triangular numbers (T) defined by n(n+1)/2, thus
    #y is triangular if the following is an integer
    n <- (sqrt((8*y)+1) - 1) / 2
    if(as.integer(n) == n){
      return(TRUE) # function will end here in n is integer
    }
    #if n is not integer, return FALSE
    return(FALSE)
  }
```

Make sure that after you enter your function into the editor that you execute it to load it into the environment and make it available for use.

* either highlight the whole function or place the cursor on the first or last line of the function and `ctrl`+`enter` 

This function identifies numbers that are triangular.

![](Week06_files/triangular.png)

After the function is loaded into the environment (upper right panel of RStudio), it can be used.  Try it out in the console (lower left panel):

```R
isTriangular(4)
isTriangular(91)
```

![](Week06_files/rstudio_fuctions.png)

---

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Sourcing R Functions</summary>
<p>

If there are functions that you use frequently across different projects, you can save them into their own script and `source()` them in a different script.

You can open a new R script (use mouse), copy and paste the `isTriangular` function into new blank script, save it to `~/CSB/r/sandbox/` with the name `triangular.R`, and close it.

Once you have done that, we can use the `source()` command to read in the `isTriangular` function from the `triangular.R` script.  When you "source" a script, its entire contents are executed.

```R
# clear environment
rm(list=ls())

# now isTriangular is gone and will not work
isTriangular(4)  #should return an Error

# source the triangular.R script to load the isTriangular() function
source("triangular.R") # note that file names have to be quotfied to distinguish from variables
isTriangular(4)
isTriangular(91)
```

![](Week06_files/rstudio_source.png)

---

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>More Function Sourcing</summary>
<p>

We are going to add another function to the `triangular.R` script (open it).  

The function will be called `findTriangular` and will accept an argument that sets the upper limit on the numbers to search for triangular numbers (between 1 and `max_number`) and will pass it into the function under the variable name `max_number`. Copy and paste it into `triangular.R`

```R
# function to find and store triangular numbers
findTriangular <- function(max_number){
  to_test <- 1:max_number
  triangular_numbers <- numeric(0)
  for(i in to_test){
    if(isTriangular(i)){
      triangular_numbers <- c(triangular_numbers, i)
    }
  }
  print(paste("There are", 
              length(triangular_numbers), 
              "triangular numbers between 1 and ", 
              max_number))
  return(triangular_numbers)
}
```

Then save and close the `triangular.R` script. Now, you can source the script to load the function and use it.

```R
rm(list=ls())
source("triangular.R")
isTriangular(91)
findTriangular(1000)
```

---

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Even More Functions</summary>
<p>

#### Can have no arguments

* `myFunc <- function(){commands}`

#### Can have multiple arguments. Variables outside of the function must be read into the function

* `myFunc <- function(a,b,c){commands}`

#### Can have default arguments. When run, `a` will be 2 unless another value is specified

* `myFunc <- function(a=2){commands}`

#### Variables outside of the function are only available by passing them into the function, and vice versa

You can explore these features by trying the following code (do not modify the `triangular.R` script)

```R
#addtional functions
rm(list=ls())

tell_fortune <- function(){
  if(runif(1) < 0.9){
    print("Today is going to change your life!")
  } else {
    print("You should have stayed in bed :-|")
  }
}
tell_fortune()

order_3 <- function(x,y,z){
  return(sort(c(x,y,z)))
}
order_3(10,7,9)

order_3_list <- function(x,y,z){
  ordered_numbers <- sort(c(x,y,z))
  return(list("1st" = ordered_numbers[1],
              "2nd" = ordered_numbers[2],
              "3rd" = ordered_numbers[3]))
}
order_3_list(10,7,9)

split_string <- function(s, separator = "_"){
  return(strsplit(s, separator)[[1]])
}
split_string("I_get_it!")
```

<details><summary>R Packages & Libraries</summary>
<p>

A package is a collection of R code, data, and functions that have been made publicly available

* There are over 14,000 R packages

* Packages must be installed

  * `install.packages(“name_of_pkg”)`

* Once installed, packages must be loaded

  * `library(name_of_pkg)`

*Note that packages that are being installed need to be quotified, but after they are installed, the should not be quotified.  Why do you think that is?*

Where to find packages specialized for your research questions

* https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/

* https://github.com/ 

* https://www.bioconductor.org/ 


Making packages

* [R Studio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486488-Developing-Packages-with-RStudio)

* http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/ 

When you add a package, you are adding commands and functionality.  Once installed, packages must be called using `library()` to allow you to use them. 

```R
# Search for Packages
RSiteSearch("AMOVA")

# install all packages related to a particular field
install.packages("ctv")

# load the ctv package commands

<details><summary>Avoiding Library Conflicts</summary>
<p>

Library conflicts occur when you load two libraries that have at least one command with the same name.  For example, many packages have a `select` command.  These commands only share the same name, but they are, in fact, different.

Library conflicts are a primary reason why R code breaks. You can avoid this by using the library name when you call the command.  In the example below, the library is `dplyr` and the command is `select`

```r
# don't type this in right now
dplyr::select()
```


The order that libraries are loaded affects which library takes precidence over another library. If another library with a `select` command is loaded after `dplyr`, it's `select` command will take precidence unless the package and command are specified, as in the code block above.

When you are loading libraries, you will be notified of these conflicts in the "console" (lower left panel)

<details><summary>R Random Numbers</summary>
<p>

Random numbers are useful for simulations and customized tests for statistical significance

* Random number from [uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_(continuous))

  * `runif(number_of_random_nums)`

* Random number from [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)

  * `rnorm(num_rands, mean=x, sd=y)`

* Random number from [binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution), aka coin flipping

  * `rbinom(num_rands, num_trials, 	probabilty)`

* Random number from [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution)

  * `rpois(num_rands, lambda=x)`

* Permute 

  * `sample(vector_or_list, 	num_samps)`

* [Bootstrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_%28statistics%29)

  * `sample(vector_or_list, 	num_samps, replace = 	TRUE)`


```R
rm(list=ls())

runif(3)            #random numbers from uniform distribution

rnorm(5, 15, 5)     #random numbers from normal distribution, simulate quantitative phenotypes
rbinom(1, 10, 0.5)  #random numbers from binomial distribution, simulate coin flipping, genetic drift, genotypes
rpois(6, 10)        #random numbers from Poisson distribution, simulate count data

x <- 1:10
sample(x,10)              #permutation test, randomly assign individuals to treatments
sample(x,10,replace=TRUE) #bootstrapping

```

<details><summary>R Loops are Slow</summary>
<p>

For and while loops in R are easy to use but are very slow because R runs commands 1 by 1 and does not know what is coming next.  

In faster languages, like `C`, code is compiled and all commands are known before running, allowing for optimization.

Here we use a for loop to calculate the mean of each row in a very large matrix filled with random numbers and record the length of time to complete the task


```R
rm(list=ls())

#make a matrix with 10000 rows and columns filled with uniform random numbers between 0 and 1
M <- matrix(runif(10000*10000),10000,10000)

#Function that calculates row means of M without vectorization
get_row_means <- function(M){
	#set up vector to capture results
	row_means <- rep(1, nrow(M))
	
	#loop through rows, calc the mean of each, and save into row_means vector
	for(i in 1:nrow(M)){
		row_means[i] <- mean(M[i,])
	}
return(row_means)
}

#measure time to complete get_row_means
system.time(get_row_means(M))
```

<details><summary>Vectorized R Loops are Fast</summary>
<p>

Vectorized functions can run loops much faster because R only has to figure out the flow for 1 element in the vector and the code runs much faster. 

The built-in command, `rowMeans()`, is vectorized and does the same thing as the function we defined previously.

Now we will vectorize the calculation of row means and measure how long it takes to complete the task

```R
#measure time to complete vectorized rowMeans()
system.time(rowMeans(M))
```

<details><summary>DIY Vectorization of Loops with `apply()`</summary>
<p>

`lapply(list_of_values, function)`

* applies a function to each element in list and returns a list of results

* note that `unlist(list_of_vals)` changes the list into a vector

`sapply(list_of_values, function)`

* Just like lapply, but returns a vector

Let us try it out.  

In the example below, the user-defined function `count_nucl` accepts 2 arguments `(seq, nucl)`. The list `DNAlist` populates `seq`, the second argument is explicitly specified  in the `sapply` statement: , `nucl =  ‘A’`

```R
rm(list=ls())

#use lapply to create list of matrices and make list filled with NA
Mlist <- as.list(rep(NA, length = 20))

#function to generate small random matrices
randMat <- function(x){
  return(matrix(rnorm(25),5,5))
}
Mlist <- lapply(Mlist, randMat)


#use lapply to find largest eigen val in each matrix
Meig <- lapply(Mlist, function(x) return(eigen(x, only.values=TRUE)$values[1]))
print(unlist(Meig))


#use sapply to count nucleotides
DNAlist <- list(A='GTTTCG',
                B='GCCGCA',
                C='TTATAG', 
                D='CGACGA')


#function to count nucleotides
count_nucl <- function(seq, nucl){

  #return list of positions with match
  pos <- gregexpr(pattern=nucl, text=seq)[[1]]
  
  #change -1, no match, to 0
  if(pos[1] == "-1"){
    return(0)
  } else {
    return(length(pos))
  }
}

numAs <- sapply(DNAlist, count_nucl, nucl = 'A')
print(numAs)

numGs <- sapply(DNAlist, count_nucl, nucl = 'G')
print(numGs)  

```

<details><summary>R Debugging</summary>
<p>

Errors in the code (bugs) are common

* Some errors elicit warning messages or cause code to stop

* Silent errors can be hard to detect, thus it is important to test your code 

  * Use test data with known answer
  
  * Check values in data structures (in the global environment, upper right panel)
  
* You can also pause your code using `browser()`


```R
#Debugging
rm(list=ls())

myfun <- function(i,x){
	for(z in 1:i){
		x <- x*2
		browser()
}
return(x)
}
myfun(3,4)
```

![](Week06_files/rstudio_debugging.png)

After you run the code, you enter debugging mode at the line of `browser()` command in your script

* View local variables with `ls()`

* Check values of variables

* Press n to execute next statement

* Check value of `x` again

* Press Q to exit browser and function

* Press c to continue function and exit browser

<details><summary>Auto formatting in R Studio</summary>
<p>

In RStudio, a lot of formatting is done automatically for you, making it very convenient for developing R code.

Further, the `Code` drop down menu contains functions specific to code formatting

* Code / Reformat Code

* Code  / Reindent Lines 

![](Week06_files/rstudio_codeformatting.png)

You can also use the package [`styler`](https://github.com/r-lib/styler) to do a bit more automatic styling than just the Reformat and Reindent functions in R Studio.

```r
install.packages("styler")
```

Once installed, there will be style options under the "Addins" pull down menu.

R is a stats language and has many statistical functions built-in


```R
rm(list=ls())
data(iris)    #load built-in iris dataset

#useful commands for exploring data
str(iris)     #show columns in data
summary(iris) #show summary stats
table(iris$Species) #number of observations by spp
table(iris$Species, iris$Petal.Width) #number of observations by species and petal width
range(iris$Petal.Length)  #min and max
by(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species, mean) #mean by group
cor(iris$Sepal.Length,iris$Petal.Length) #correlation
pairs(iris) #matrix scatterplot to visualize correlations
rank(iris$Sepal.Length) #return rank of each observation from smallest to largest

#extract rows of data frame based on value match
noSetosa <- subset(iris, iris$Species != "setosa")

#return row num based on condition match
which(iris$Petal.Length > 6)
which.max(iris$Petal.Length)

```

[t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test):  compare two samples and determine the probability that the differences are due to random chance.  _Fun fact: the t-test was developed in the Guinness Brewery._ 

* `t.test(vector1, vector2)`

* `t.test(dataVector ~ groupVector)`

Linear regression

* `lm(responseVector ~ predictorVector)`

ANOVA

* `lm(responseVector ~ predictorVector)`

* `anova()`

let us try some of these:

```R
#t-test   compare two samples
t.test(Sepal.Width[Species == "setosa"], 
	 Sepal.Width[Species == "versicolor"],
	 data=iris)

t.test(Sepal.Width ~ Species, data=noSetosa)

#linear regression
linear_model <- lm(Sepal.Width ~ Sepal.Length, data=iris)
summary(linear_model)

#anova   compare many samples
petalL_ANOVA <- lm(Petal.Length ~ Species, data=iris)
anova(petalL_ANOVA)
summary(petalL_ANOVA)

```

<details><summary>Running R Script from Linux Command Line</summary>
<p>

You may want to run your r script on a super computer or use it in a bash script

* `Rscript my_script.R`

You can pass arguments from bash into R

* `Rscript my_script.R arg1 arg2`

In your rscript you must pass the arguments into a variable

* `args <- commandArgs(TRUE)`

It is a best practice to define default values and order the arguments so the optional follow the required

Print the variable values to document what settings were used


```R
#capturing arguments from the command line in an r script 
args <- commandArgs(TRUE) #read the arguments
num_args <- length(args)  #count the arguments

#set default values
input_file <- "test.txt"
num_reps <- 10
start_point <- 3.14

#change default value if argument given 
if(num_args >= 1){
input_file <- args[1]
}
if(num_args >= 2){
num_reps <- args[2]
}
if(num_args >= 3){
start_point <- args[3]
}

print(c(input_file, num_reps, start_point))
```
