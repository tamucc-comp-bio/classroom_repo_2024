## Computer Preparation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure your computer is ready to complete the assignment

<p>

- [ ] Step 0. Open Terminal

  > Search for the terminal app and open it.  For Windows, make sure you are using Ubuntu.

  > You should have already prepared your computer during Lecture 0.  If you did not then:  

  > * Complete the tasks listed in the [How to Set Up Your Computer for Computational Biology](https://github.com/tamucc-comp-bio/how_to/blob/main/howto_setup_computer.md), up to, but not including R and RStudio.
  >    * If you are having difficulty installing ubuntu, use Launch if your account is activated.

- [ ] Step 1. Update Your apps

  > It's always a good idea to keep your apps in your terminal up to date. 
  
  > For Ubuntu (Linux), enter the following commands to load the newest versions of your apps

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade
  ```

  > For Mac (Homebrew), enter the following commands to load the newest versions of your apps

  ```bash
  brew update
  brew upgrade
  ```

- [ ] Step 2. Confirm you have cloned the CSB (Computing Skills For Biologists) Repo into your home dir

    > In your terminal, enter the following commands:

    ```bash
    # make sure you're in your home dir
    cd ~
    
    # list the directories and files in the CSB dir to confirm it's in your home dir
    ls CSB
    ```

    > You should see the following output because we cloned the CSB Repo to your home dir in [Lecture 0](https://github.com/tamucc-comp-bio/classroom_repo_2024/blob/master/lectures/lecture00.md).  

    ```bash
    LICENSE  README.md  data_wrangling  git  good_code  latex  python  r  regex  scientific  sql  unix
    ```

    > If you see the output above, you're done! Goto the next section.

- [ ] Step 3. If you didn't have the CSB Repo, clone it now

  > If you **do not** see the output above, then clone the CSB repo by entering the following commands:

    ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB.git
    ``` 

  > You should see the following output:

    ```bash
    Cloning into 'CSB'...
    remote: Enumerating objects: 1005, done.
    remote: Total 1005 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 1005 (from 1)
    Receiving objects: 100% (1005/1005), 26.68 MiB | 7.74 MiB/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (389/389), done.
    ```

  > Goto Step 2 above.

 - [ ] Step 0. [Log Into Launch HPC](https://portal-launch.hprc.tamu.edu/)

    > Use the following [link](https://portal-launch.hprc.tamu.edu/) to log in 

    > You should have already created your account during Lecture 0.  If you did not then:  
    > * Complete the tasks listed in the [Accessing Launch Instructions](https://hprc.tamu.edu/kb/User-Guides/Launch/Access/#no-ssh-login)

 - [ ] Step 1. Open Terminal

    > Select `launch Shell Access`

 - [ ] Step 2. Confirm you have cloned the CSB (Computing Skills For Biologists) Repo into your home dir

  > In your terminal, enter the following commands:

    ```bash
    # make sure you're in your home dir
    cd ~

    # list the directories and files in the CSB dir to confirm it's in your home dir
    ls CSB
    ```

  > You should see the following output because we cloned the CSB Repo to your home dir in [Lecture 0](https://github.com/tamucc-comp-bio/classroom_repo_2024/blob/master/lectures/lecture00.md).

## Exercises

Complete the Mind Expanders up through 8.5.  You can use the resources in this markdown document, google searches, and/or the CSB text book (the Mind Expanders are based in the "intermezzos") to gain the context required to complete this assignment.

To receive credit in the TAMUCC course, Computational Skills for 21st Century Biologists, use the primary (first link) for each Mind Expander, not the "Outside TAMUCC" link.
